#Opendoor Case Study
##Overview and Origin
Opendoor was launched in 2014 with the mission of reinventing the way individuals buy and sell homes, as well as empowering all individuals with the freedom to move easy and hassle free.  Opendoor was founded by Eric Wu, Ian Wong, and Keith Rabois.  Eric Wu and Ian Wong currently serve as the CEO and CTO of Opendoor, respectively.  Even though Keith Rabois is considered a co-founder, he served more as a venture capitalist for the startup of the company.

The story of Opendoor really started when Eric Wu was 19 years old and a sophomore in college.  Motivated by the desire to not pay rent, Wu utilized scholarship money to purchase his first home.  He then lived in this home and rented out the spare bedrooms.  From there, Wu eventually refinanced the home and used the equity to purchase another home.  This process continued to snowball, and eventually Wu owned 20+ properties by the time he graduated.  In addition to real estate, Wu also had a passion for computer technology.  He would build websites to promote and rent out his income properties.  Wu decided early on that he wanted to merge these two passions and create a platform to resolve consumer difficulties in the real estate industry, such as lengthy closing periods, excessive fees, and complexities in moving to a completely new city or state.  

After two successful start-ups (RentAdvisor & Movity), which were both created to benefit consumers and their search for housing, Eric Wu co-founded Opendoor in 2014.  Opendoor is funded by private equity, and as of latest reports has received a total of $1.3 billion in funding, according to Forbes.  The bulk of Opendoor's funding has come from three main sources: Khosla Ventures, SoftBank, and General Atlantic.  Opendoor originally began operations after raising $9.95 million in 2014, most of which came from Khosla Ventures.  In 2018, a total of $400 million in funding was received from SoftBank Group, and in 2019 another $300 million in funding was raised, primarily led by General Atlantic.
##Business Activities
When Opendoor was founded, one of Eric Wu's main missions was to making moving possible, and easier for everyone.  Moving can be a significant financial burden, as well as mentally taxing. Wu's vision was to remove the "middleman" in the home buying process, streamlining the entire process and alleviating potential financial burdens of consumers in the process. Enter, Opendoor.  Opendoor currently allows individuals to buy and sell their home completely online in twenty-one cities.  Home sellers have the freedom to request all cash offers directly from Opendoor, which offers a completely digital and contract free transaction.  From offer, to inspection, to closing, everything is done online.  If the seller chooses this route and takes the all-cash deal from Opendoor they can skip the inconvenience and costs associated with home repairs, house showings, etc.  By eliminating the middleman, Opendoor offers a streamlined and cost-effective process for customers, which vastly increases the opportunities to move for consumers who may not have been able to do so otherwise.  

In addition to offering services to home sellers, Opendoor also offers a buying option to consumers.  Opendoor offers two options for purchasers: buy a home directly from Opendoor (Opendoor-owned home) or buy any home on the market with the assistance of Opendoor.  Similar to selling a home, Opendoor offers consumers the convenience of buying online with cost savings and simple, stress free offer submissions.  If a consumer chooses to not purchase a home directly from Opendoor, they have the option to be paired with an Opendoor agent or choose their own agent to work with.  Different options have different cost savings associated with them.  A convenient, “How to buy a house in 8 simple steps.” guide is offered on opendoor.com.  

Long term, Opendoor’s intent is to serve all customers in the real estate market.  Currently the real estate market transacts approximately $1.4 trillion annually, according to Forbes.  Opendoor has already disrupted the industry and will continue to do so as they expand beyond the current twenty-one cities they currently serve.  According to a Seattle Times Article in 2018, the Real Estate industry is the next  industry to be disrupted by technology.  When Opendoor entered the market, they excelled in offering what competitors in the market did not: a streamlined home buying/selling process leveraging current technology that could be done completely online, lower transactions costs due to improved efficiencies and removal of intermediaries, and speedy transactions.  In today’s evolving technology driven market, consumers were quickly willing to adapt and welcomed a change to what can be a stressful, antiquated process.  

To be successful, Opendoor leverages numerous technologies.  These technologies are used to analyze home prices, market trends, perform neighborhood analyses, create liquidity models, generate home valuations, etc.  Below are examples of some of the technologies used by Opendoor, as described on their website.
* Machine Learning is leveraged to improve valuation models and to better interpret subdivisions.  Homes are given values and multiple variables are determined to mathematically articulate subdivision data.  PySpark is a common tool used to interpret the data and provide valuable data to label subdivisions.  
* Time series analysis is used to value homes and forecast how long inventory will take to sell.  This assists Opendoor in determining liquidity risks.  NumPy is another tool incorporated to assist with predictive models. 
* S3, which is managed by AWS, is used as a storage dump.  This allows Opendoor to leverage costs and efficiency.  Spark is used as a Big Data processing system as well.
* Technologies that are utilized, which impact customer experience, are things like AI, virtual reality, and augmented reality.  AI is used as a virtual assistant for customers, which will search for homes that fit their desires.  Virtual reality allows consumers to virtually tour a home prior to purchase, and augmented reality allows consumers to stage or furnish a home prior to purchase.  

##Landscape:
Opendoor is a part of the Real Estate/Mortgage domain of the financial industry.  One of the major trends and innovations in this domain over the last five to ten years has been the ability to complete a transaction completely online.  With enhancing technology, consumers can search for homes, view homes virtually, and complete all financial transactions online.  As mentioned above, improvements in virtual and augmented reality help provide customers piece of mind with complete viewing / touring abilities of a home prior to purchase.  Another major trend has been increased transaction time.  Gone are the days of waiting weeks to close on a home sale.  With companies like Opendoor, a home sale can be closed within three days.  Finally, another major innovation has been continued developments of computer programming and analysis programs.  As technology continues to evolve, companies like Opendoor gain more and more ability to accurately analyze market trends, evaluate individual home and neighborhood values, and generate liquidity analysis to better serve their customer’s needs, as well as their business needs.    

Within the real estate industry there are multiple major companies and competitors.  Some major competitors to Opendoor are Zillow, Redfin, and Offerpad.  First is Zillow, which operates its Zillow Offers platform to compete with companies like Opendoor.  Zillow Offers operates in a very similar manner to Opendoor; it makes cash offers to homeowners expeditiously and is a streamlined, online service provided to consumers.  As outlined on their website, this platform promotes speed and ease to potential customers.  Zillow Offers operates in twenty-four cities currently and was launched in 2018.  Redfin is also a top competitor, who launched RedfinNow in 2017.  RedfinNow is also similar to Opendoor, as they offer a complete online experience and make cash offers to sellers.  RedfinNow appeals to customers by focusing on three core principles: certainty, convenience, and control.  RedfinNow currently operates in ten cities, with plans to expand in the near future.  One interesting note regarding Redfin, they have a partnership with Opendoor.  This partnership offers sellers the opportunity to explore their option of selling directly to Opendoor for cash or leveraging a full-service Redfin agent to list their home on the open market.  This partnership started as an option in only two cities but has since expanded to nine more cities.   

A final major competitor to Opendoor to mention is Offerpad.  Offerpad was founded in 2015 and was one of the first major competitors to Opendoor.  Offerpad is similar to both Opendoor and Zillow Offers, in that they make cash offers, or offer the option to connect customers with a company partner to sell their home.  However, Offerpad offers one thing other competitors discussed do not: free local moves with professional movers.  Offerpad operates on many core principles as Opendoor, which are speed, convenience, flexibility, and cost savings.  With the real estate industry constantly evolving and with more major competitors entering the realm, technology will continue to play a key role in Opendoor’s success.  

##Results
Since their beginning in 2014, Opendoor has continued to disrupt the real estate market.  So much so that established real estate companies like Redfin and Zillow developed their own platforms just to compete with companies like Opendoor.  Numerous competitors have since entered the marketplace, and many more are likely to come.  Technology has vastly changed the way real estate companies interact with their customers and provide their services.  This trend will continue to grow as technology advances.  Consumers continue to be interested in how technology can streamline their lives, reduce stress, and save them money, especially in today’s world.  Companies of old have had to find ways to adapt, in the form of their own developments or via partnerships, otherwise be left behind.  

For a company like Opendoor to be successful, multiple factors come into play.  However, two key factors can determine success or failure – home valuation and days on market.  Home valuation and days on market go hand in hand.  Opendoor leverages numerous technology programs to conduct effective research and determine proper home valuation.  The more accurate the valuation, the better profit potential for Opendoor.  Generally, when a home is valued correctly, assuming a strong selling market, the home will sell faster, meaning less days on market.  In a strong real estate market such as the Phoenix market currently, the average days on market is approximately 68 days, per Opendoor.  On average, Opendoor’s days on market is 90 days.  

##Recommendations
If I were to advise Opendoor, one suggestion I would make would be to offer moving truck drop off / delivery.  The reason for this is simple – one of Opendoor’s missions is to remove all pain points from the home buying process.  One key component of buying or selling a home is having to move after, which often involves renting a moving truck.  Often this can be one of the bigger pain points of moving.  This platform could operate similarly as Zipcar or car2go platforms.  Since customers can choose their own closing date when selling through Opendoor, moving truck delivery could be coordinated easily.  The customer would simply arrive at their old home to complete packing, pack up the moving truck that is there waiting for them, courtesy of Opendoor, and drive to their new home.  Once the customer is done with the moving truck, they notify Opendoor through an online portal that the truck can be picked up.  Once again, this would further streamline the entire process for the customer.  This service would only be offered to customers who took the cash offer and sold their home directly to Opendoor and to customers who purchased their home from Opendoor.   

According to 2019 moving statistics from Moving.com, approximately 10% of the US population moves per year; this totaled 32 million people in 2018.  Of those people, 85% move within the same state.  Based on 2018 moving data, 34% of consumers rent a moving truck, 47% move unassisted, and 19% move with professional movers.  With a convenient service of moving truck delivery in place, the appeal to buy and sell with Opendoor becomes even greater.  Additionally, Opendoor would get increased advertising as customers move with Opendoor wrapped trucks, potentially raising awareness of the company and services they offer.  Another benefit would be differentiation from competition.  Numerous competitors have entered the market and will likely continue to do so.  Several of the competitors simply try to offer the exact same service as Opendoor.  A service like this would allow Opendoor to be a first in the industry and continue to boost overall customer satisfaction and trust. 

A key technology that would help implement this recommendation would be blockchain technology.  Utilizing blockchain would allow Opendoor to monitor transactions of home sales and analyze data of how often this service is being utilized, and to what capacity.  It would also allow them to gather key insight into customer moving patterns and market trends.  Machine learning could also be utilized to implement this recommendation.  A virtual personal assist could be set up for each customer to assist with the coordination of this service, as well as provide support and feedback throughout the process. 

Another suggestion for Opendoor is an owner portal for home buyers.  What this portal would do is offer a similar valuation for the home being purchased, except it would allow the owner to select upgrades to their home.  An example of this could be kitchen cabinets.  Within the owner portal, the owner could select from various upgrade options to their current kitchen cabinets.  Using a similar valuation technique that Opendoor currently uses for valuing homes to buy from consumers, an updated estimation of valuation could be provided to the homeowner, reflecting the upgrades that are being considered.  A full portal would be available to customers who purchased their home from Opendoor.  As for prospective buyers, they would be able to view limited examples of the home they are considering buying.  This service would be a value add to customers and would potentially help customers see the value in buying a certain home, especially if the home is in a seller’s market where purchasing your dream home can be out of reach.  This service would also be a great differentiator from the competition.  With this value add, more customers could potentially be motivated to buy from Opendoor.  Customers would have access to this portal throughout the tenure of their home ownership.  All updates could be logged into the portal, allowing the customer to track all upgrades they have done and have an estimation of value if the home were to be sold. This also encourages buyers to become future sellers by having their valuation tracked throughout their ownership.

To implement this suggestion, Opendoor could leverage current technologies used, such as Python to program this feature.  Additionally, Opendoor could leverage augmented reality to help customers view what changes to the home could look like.  This would allow customers to determine if they aesthetically like the updates being considered and perform a cost/benefit analysis of potential updates.  Finally, machine learning could be leveraged to assist in updated valuations.  Current valuation formulas used by Opendoor could be programmed accordingly to reflect updates to the home and return a new, estimated valuation.
